**Day 16: LeetCode 704 [Binary Search]**

**Problem Description:**
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.
